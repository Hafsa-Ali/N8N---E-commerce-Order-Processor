## 📦 Order Fulfillment Workflow

| Step | Node | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Webhook – New Order Received** | Trigger – receives new order details (orderId, customer, items, quantity). |
| 2 | **Split Out** | Splits order items array so each product can be processed individually. |
| 3 | **Check Inventory (Google Sheets)** | Looks up product stock in inventory database. ([Inventory Database](https://github.com/Hafsa-Ali/N8N---E-commerce-Order-Processor/commit/9e28e474808e94fac29d0d5044c371476909f98b)) |
| 4 | **If (Stock Check)** | Compares requested quantity with available stock. |
| 5 | **Append Row (TRUE branch)** | Adds order details to **Fulfillment Queue** sheet for processing. ([Fullfillment Sheet](https://github.com/Hafsa-Ali/N8N---E-commerce-Order-Processor/commit/9e28e474808e94fac29d0d5044c371476909f98b)) |
| 6 | **Send Slack Message (TRUE branch)** | Notifies fulfillment team with order + packing list. |
| 7 | **Send Gmail (FALSE branch)** | Sends alert email to Inventory Manager if stock is too low. |

✅ **TRUE branch** → Order added to queue + team notified  
❌ **FALSE branch** → Inventory Manager alerted for restock
